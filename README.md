This is my AACS2123 Computer Game Development Assignment. This is a 2D tower defense game where players have to defend the town hall by collecting resources such as woods and stones that are randomly generated around the map. Once the player gathered enough resources, they can build different towers that will defend the town hall from the monsters by attacking the monsters. Different towers have different health point and can deal different amount of damage to the monsters. There is also a destroyable stone wall which can be used to block monster's path. Players can also unlock different weapons such as blade and scythe to attack the monsters too. There are 6 waves of monsters with different monsters each waves. There will also be mini bosses and final bosses towards the later waves.
